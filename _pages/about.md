I am a fourth-year undergraduate student in [Prof. Hongzheng Zhao's group](https://faculty.pku.edu.cn/zhaohongzheng/zh_CN/index/51480/list/index.htm) at the School of Physics, Peking University in Beijing, China.

Currently, I am working on non-equilibrium many-body dynamics, with a particular focus on classical systems. My research interests also include quantum computation, quantum information, open quantum systems, and any fascinating topic in statistical mechanics, classical mechanics, and quantum mechanics. See [Publications](Publications) and [Projects](Projects) for more details.
